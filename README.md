## Summary

The skeleton server is the place where we can define what our servers should look
like and how we assemble them.  It is intentionally simple so that doing a few
important things is both simple and clear.  This has the following benefits:

1. It's easy to see what we want to do.
2. It's easy to proove that it will work.
3. It's a good base for new servers that will be built.
